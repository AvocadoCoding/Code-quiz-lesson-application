## About the project
I have written javascript, HTML and CSS code to create a quiz application to test users front-end web development knowledge. The application asks users five multiple choice qeustions about significant front-end web development topics. A time starts counting down once the user starts the quiz, and for every wrong answer there is a 15 second time penalty. At the end of the quiz the users remaining time is recorded as the final score, and the user can save their initals with their score to the scoreboard.
